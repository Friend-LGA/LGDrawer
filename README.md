### With CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. To install with cocoaPods, follow the "Get Started" section on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

#### Podfile
```ruby
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'LGDrawer', '~> 1.0.0'
```

### With Carthage

Carthage is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods. To install with carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/).

#### Cartfile
```
github "Friend-LGA/LGDrawer" ~> 1.0.0
```

## Usage

In the source files where you need to use the library, import the header file:

```objective-c
#import "LGDrawer.h"
```

### Draw

For example how to draw rectangle:

```objective-c
UIImage *rectangle = [LGDrawer drawRectangleWithImageSize:CGSizeMake(90.f, 90.f)
                                                     size:CGSizeMake(60.f, 60.f)
                                                   offset:CGPointZero
                                                   rotate:0.f
                                           roundedCorners:UIRectCornerBottomLeft|UIRectCornerTopRight
                                             cornerRadius:10.f
                                          backgroundColor:[UIColor whiteColor]
                                                fillColor:[UIColor blueColor]
                                              strokeColor:[UIColor blackColor]
                                          strokeThickness:2.f
                                               strokeDash:@[@4.f, @2.f] // first - length of line, second - length of space | you can use more arguments in array
                                               strokeType:LGDrawerStrokeTypeCenter
                                              shadowColor:[UIColor colorWithWhite:0.f alpha:0.5]
                                             shadowOffset:CGPointMake(2.f, 2.f)
                                               shadowBlur:6.f]
```
